        If you say that actions speak louder than words, you mean that people's
        actions show their real attitudes, rather than what they say.

      <p>
        This expression is sometimes used to advise a person to do something

        <p>
          After a devastating flood in early June that affected around 4 million
          residents, the same area was hit again with record-breaking rainfall
          that began on June 15. Most of the Sylhet city has gone underwater
          again, with water continuing to rise, worsening the condition of those
          still living in temporary shelters and further exposed to extreme
          weather and waterborne diseases.
